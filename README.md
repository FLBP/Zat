Zat from factorization, is a **free**, **smartly parsed** and **half-open-source** programming language.
## Free language
Of course, like almost every programming languages, Zat is free. It is entirely financed by its own members (from Onagan),
so if you would like to give something back by helping with the running costs then any donations are gratefully received.

## Smartly parsed language
The parser converts every operations into a serialized [SAT problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem).
Once your code has been serialized into a .ZATS (Serialized Zat code) file, you can run it on your terminal.
## Half-open-source language
Almost all of the code is open-source, except the SAT resolution algorithm, named FLBP (according to **F** actorization by **L** inear **B** oolean **P** artitions, futhermore it is also its creator acronyme) which is kept secret, like the Coca-cola recipes.
## Progress
We are programming the 0.1 version (beta) : [See ZATCODE](./ZATCODE.md)
The 1.* first stable version will be furnished with the IDE
- [x] Grammar and syntax (coming soon on the wiki)
- [x] SAT solver (hiden)
    - [x] algorithm
    - [x] intern constraints serialization
    - [x] extern constraints
- [ ] Parser
    - [ ] basic operations to CNF

Going on with our project, next steps will follow.
